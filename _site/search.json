    "text": "Abstract\nWe all aim to use data to tell a compelling story, and many of us enjoy sharing how we got there by open-sourcing our code, but we don’t always share our story with everyone. Even kind, supportive, and open communities like the #TidyTuesday R learning community on Twitter has a ways to go before the content shared can be accessible to everyone.Lived experiences of blind R users tell us that most data visualizations shared for TidyTuesday are inaccessible to screen reading technology because they lack alternative text (i.e. alt text) descriptions. Our goal was to bring this hidden lack of accessibility to the surface by examining the alternative text accompanying data visualizations shared as part of the TidyTuesday social project.We scraped the alternative text from 6,443 TidyTuesday images posted on Twitter between April 2, 2018 and January 31, 2021. The first image attached to each tweet was considered the primary image and was scraped for alternative text. Manual web inspection revealed the CSS class and HTML element corresponding to the primary image, as well as the attribute containing the alternative text. We used this information and the ROpenSci {RSelenium} package to scrape the alternative text. Our preliminary analysis found that only 2.4% of the images contained a text description entered by the tweet author compared to 84% which were described by default as ‘Image.’This small group of intentional alternative text descriptions had a median word count of 18 (range: 1-170), and a median character count of 83 (range: 8-788). As a reference point, Twitter allows 240 characters in a single tweet and 1,000 characters for image descriptions. This analysis was made possible thanks to a dataset of historical TidyTuesday tweet data collected using the ROpenSci {rtweet} package, and openly available in the TidyTuesday GitHub repository.We will present during Session 0 on May 4, 2021: Crowdcast Link"

You can click or tap on the circle map markers to see information about each restaurant/bar along with a direct link to their posted happy hour specials.\nCheck out the link at the top of this post for a larger version of the interactive map below.

In other words, the map markers and text looked too small when viewed on a mobile device.\n\n\nChanging the webpage title\nThe webpage title was a quick one to fix thanks to a Stack Overflow response to a question about turning off the title in an R Markdown document. The pagetitle YAML option lets you set the HTML’s title tag independently of the document title:\npagetitle: \"Philly CCD Sips 2022 Map\"\n\n\nFixing the mobile-responsiveness\nThe mobile-responsiveness issue could be solved by adding metadata to the map HTML, but I would need to be able to blend HTML with R code. I have been practicing using Quarto and figured I could make a standalone map from a Quarto document (.qmd) rather than an R Markdown one (.Rmd or .Rmarkdown). You can find the map’s Quarto document alongside this blog post.\nAccording to the Leaflet library documentation and this Stack Overflow answer, fixing the map to be mobile-responsive required adding the following metadata to the HTML code:\n&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\nI used the metathis R package to add this metadata to an R code chunk in my Quarto document using the meta_viewport() function:\n# make mobile-responsive\nmeta_viewport(\n  width = \"device-width\",\n  initial_scale = \"1.0\",\n  maximum_scale = \"1.0\",\n  user_scalable = \"no\"\n  )\n\nUpdate: In the process of updating this post I’m noticing that specifying the viewport metadata tag doesn’t seem to be necessary anymore, and I don’t understand why 🤔 …so I’ll leave the step as is, just in case it’s helpful to anyone 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\n\nAdding social media tags\nThen I added more metadata. I was particularly interested in adding social media tags so that if I (or anyone else) shared this map webpage, an informative preview would display as a social card.\nI used the meta_social() function to add these tags:\n# tags for social media\nmeta_social(\n  title = \"Philly CCD Sips 2022 Interactive Map\",\n  url = \"https://www.silviacanelon.com/blog/2022-ccd-sips/map.html\",\n  image = \"https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/main/content/blog/2022-05-31-ccd-sips/featured.png?raw=true\",\n  image_alt = \"Map of Philly's Center City with a pop-up saying Center City District Sips 2022\",\n  og_type = \"website\",\n  og_author = \"Silvia Canelón\",\n  twitter_card_type = \"summary_large_image\",\n  twitter_creator = \"@spcanelon\"\n)\nGreat, I had added all of the metadata I was interested in! Except that because I was using Quarto, and not one of the more common outputs I had a couple of extra steps to take:\n\nWrite my metadata tags to an HTML file, using the write_meta() function:\n# write meta tags to file\nwrite_meta(path = \"meta-map.html\")\nManually include this HTML in my webpage via the Quarto file. The include-in-header Quarto YAML option helped me here:\ninclude-in-header: meta-map.html\n\n\n\nMaking the map fullscreen\nA side effect of creating the map from a Quarto (or R Markdown) document is that the output is styled by default to fit within the width of an article (in this case 900 pixels). I wanted the map to take up the whole width of the page, so I made use of the page-layout Quarto YAML option:\nformat: \n  html:\n    page-layout: custom\nAnother option that worked pretty well was to use the column: screen code chunk option built into Quarto. The Quarto documentation even shows an example to display a Leaflet map I but it left a thin margin at the top margin, and I wanted the map to be flush against the top edge of the webpage.\n\n\nRendering the standalone map\nLastly, I added one more option to the YAML that would render the Quarto document into a self-contained HTML with all of the content needed to create the map.\nformat:\n  html:\n    page-layout: custom\n    self-contained: true"

Many thanks to Chief Editor Joe Rickert for a very encouraging and helpful editorial process! I am humbled by his note on R Views:\nSilvia’s post is a mini masterpiece of clear, concise writing that elucidates complex technology within the narrow context of explaining a single well-defined task. Silvia does not attempt to say everything she knows about the subject, and she resists digressions that might obscure the path she is laying out. It is an example of achieving clarity through saying less.\nThis post will guide you step-by-step through the process of creating an HTML xaringan slide deck and deploying it to the web for easy sharing with others. We will be using the xaringan package to build the slide deck, GitHub to help us host our slides for free with GitHub Pages, and the usethis package to help us out along the way. You will get the most out of this workflow if you are already familiar with R Markdown and GitHub, and if you have already connected RStudio (or your preferred IDE) to Git and GitHub.1 The post will not cover the nuts and bolts of xaringan or talk about slide design & customization, but you can find lots of learning resources listed at the end."

You can find a summary of these findings in a WebAIM blog post and detailed information in the full report, both published on April 30, 2021.\nLearning about all of the ways that digital content is made inaccessible to people with disabilities has made me take inventory of the different ways that I have contributed to this problem (there was some shame to process here 🙈).\nThe magic of R Markdown has given me the gift of turning R code into a variety of HTML outputs including R notebooks, xaringan presentation slides, and websites like this one – all of which I’ve been able to share freely online with others. This magic though (like all magic?) comes with limitations. R tools (and technology more broadly) can’t automatically ensure that its various outputs are accessible to everyone. That’s where we come in as software developers and content creators and take personal responsibility. At the risk of extending this metaphor too far, I’ll finish by offering the framework that we all need to practice (accessibility) spells/skills in order to use these magical tools responsibly.\nAll of this to say that gaining awareness about accessibility as a way to create the more inclusive world that I want to live in has motivated me to do better. I even found myself excited to conduct accessibility audits on my digital content, including my personal website (data viz too)!"

If you need to migrate courses, I recommend taking a look at how Alison and Kelly Bodwin organized their courses and workshops into projects using this theme. I didn’t have projects prior to converting my site, but after creating a few projects post-Apéro I’m confident any projects you’ve created pre-Apéro will carry over easily.\n\nProjects on my site: https://silvia.rbind.io/project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Project listing: https://silvia.rbind.io/project\n\n\n\nIf you like videos, Alison recorded a walkthrough of this conversion process using Julia Silge’s site as an example.\nWhat not to expect\nA tutorial on how to create a Hugo Apéro site from scratch – but don’t worry! Alison covers this in a workshop she gave for R-Ladies Tunis and in the Get started series of blog posts included in the documentation site."

Both can run R code, but only .markdown files generated from .Rmarkdown benefit from some of the features available from Hugo, like the syntax highlighting built into Apéro.\n\nIf you were writing R tutorials/posts/etc. in .Rmd (like me), you will notice any code chunks you were displaying will not be formatted with proper syntax highlighting :cry: To remedy this, you will have to:\n\nChange these index.Rmd files to index.Rmarkdown (I recommend using your computer’s file explorer for this)\nRebuild your index.Rmarkdown files to index.markdown (using blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = TRUE), see the helper functions for more granular control)\nDelete the index.html output files that had previously been generated\n\n Rebuilding your R Markdown pages may not be a good idea if they contain code that might break, so please proceed with caution!\nIf you made it this far, congratulations!

    "text": "Deploying your new site\nOnce you’re happy with your new Apéro site, the last step is to merge your apero branch with the primary branch of your website repository. But first, a few steps:\n\nOptional: Create a branch of your primary branch and call it hugo-academic so that you have a snapshot of your Academic files right before the merge. Since we set up Netlify to deploy all of our branches, there will now be a live link for this new branch that you can visit whenever you feel like time traveling back to your old site. For me this link is https://hugo-academic–silvia.netlify.app/\n\nSwitch back to your apero branch and update the baseURL field in config.toml to your regular website path. In my case:\nbaseURL = \"https://silvia.rbind.io/\"\nThen commit and push this change to your apero branch.\n\nMerge your apero branch with your primary branch. I usually use git commands in a combination of the RStudio terminal and the Git pane, but for this big merge I felt more comfortable doing it on github.com! :sweat_smile: Do what feels most comfortable for you.\n\nResolve any merge conflicts (I had a few!) in the git tool of your choosing. These are the git commands GitHub recommended:\ngit fetch origin       # makes sure local files were recent\ngit checkout apero     # moves you to your `apero` branch\ngit merge main         # attempts a merge with your `main` branch\nWhen you’re finished, commit your changes and push. Then follow these next steps, also recommended by GitHub:\ngit checkout main       # moves you to your `main` branch\ngit merge --no-ff apero # creates a new commit for the merge\nThis step will sort of replace all of the files that both themes had in common with the apero version (e.g. config.toml, netlify.toml, content/publication), and leave the old Academic files alone. So you will have to delete these extra Academic files (again!). I’m not sure how to avoid this – maybe it’s not an issue when you don’t have merge conflicts? I don’t know :thinking:\n\n\nTidy up your directory (again?)\nGo through the steps above to clean out any residual Academic files from your directory. Make sure to check your content/ folders for any example files from Academic that might still be hanging around and delete them.\nThen run blogdown::serve_site() to build your new Apéro site locally. Go through the site and make sure everything looks the way it should and that links are generally pointing to the right places.\nWhen you’re satisfied, commit the changes to your primary branch!There may be a lot of files that were deleted and added during the switch to Apéro and, while not generally recommended, I used the git add . command to stage all of the changes at once, commited the changes, and then pushed. I did this after thoroughly looking through the list of changed files so I knew what was happening.\n\nWait a couple of minutes for the changes to get pushed to your primary branch (e.g. main) and then wait patiently for Netlify to build your site after the merge.\n Celebrate and share your brand new site! 🎉 🥳 🍾If you share on Twitter, use the #HugoApero hashtag so the Hugo Apéro squad can clap for you!"

This fibrillar structure is stabilized by enzymatic crosslinks initiated by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step which can be disrupted using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Murine in vivo studies have confirmed effects of BAPN on collagen nanostructure and the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of these effects in vitro by measuring D-spacing, evaluating the ratio of mature to immature crosslinks, and quantifying gene expression of type I collagen and LOX. Osteoblasts were cultured in complete media, and differentiated using ascorbic acid, in the presence or absence of 0.25mM BAPN-fumarate. The matrix produced was imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 2D Fast Fourier transforms were performed to extract D-spacing from individual fibrils. The experiment was repeated for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The D-spacing distribution of collagen produced in the presence of BAPN was shifted toward higher D-spacing values, indicating BAPN affects the morphology of collagen produced in vitro, supporting aforementioned in vivo experiments. In contrast, no difference in gene expression was found for any target gene, suggesting LOX inhibition does not upregulate the LOX gene to compensate for the reduction in aldehyde formation, or regulate expression of genes encoding type I collagen. Finally, the mature to immature crosslink ratio decreased with BAPN treatment and was linked to a reduction in peak percent area of mature crosslink hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP). In conclusion, in vitro treatment of osteoblasts with low levels of BAPN did not induce changes in genes encoding LOX or type I collagen, but led to an increase in collagen D-spacing as well as a decrease in mature crosslinks."

    "text": "Importance. Relative to what is known about pregnancy complications and sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the risk of pregnancy complications among those with sickle cell trait (SCT). There is a lack of clinical research among sickle cell carriers largely due to low sample sizes and disparities in research funding.\nObjective. To evaluate whether there is an association between SCT and a stillbirth outcome.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants. This retrospective cohort study included data on deliveries occurring between January 1, 2010, and August 15, 2017, at 4 quaternary academic medical centers within the Penn Medicine health system in Pennsylvania. The population included a total of 2482 deliveries from 1904 patients with SCT but not SCD, and 215 deliveries from 164 patients with SCD. Data were analyzed from May 3, 2019, to September 16, 2021.\nExposures. The primary exposure of interest was SCT, identified using clinical diagnosis codes recorded in the electronic health record.\nMain Outcomes and Measures. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the risk of stillbirth using the following risk factors: SCD, numbers of pain crises and blood transfusions before delivery, delivery episode (as a proxy for parity), prior cesarean delivery, multiple gestation, patient age, marital status, race and ethnicity, ABO blood type, Rhesus (Rh) factor, and year of delivery.\nResults. This cohort study included 50 560 patients (63 334 deliveries), most of whom were aged 25 to 34 years (29 387 of 50 560 [58.1%]; mean [SD] age, 29.5 [6.1] years), were single at the time of delivery (28 186 [55.8%]), were Black or African American (23 777 [47.0%]), had ABO blood type O (22 879 [45.2%]), and were Rhesus factor positive (44 000 [87.0%]). From this general population, 2068 patients (4.1%) with a sickle cell gene variation were identified: 1904 patients (92.1%) with SCT (2482 deliveries) and 164 patients (7.9%) with SCD (215 deliveries). In the fully adjusted model, SCT was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.94; 95% CI, 1.05-75.79; P = .045) while adjusting for the risk factors of SCD (aOR, 26.40; 95% CI, 2.48-280.90; P = .007) and multiple gestation (aOR, 4.68; 95% CI, 3.48-6.29; P &lt; .001).\nConclusions and Relevance. The results of this large, retrospective cohort study indicate an increased risk of stillbirth among pregnant people with SCT. These findings underscore the need for additional risk assessment during pregnancy for sickle cell carriers.\n\n\n\nDirected Acyclic Graph With Stillbirth as the Outcome and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) as the Primary Exposure of Interest.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Figure 2\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Directed Acyclic Graph With Stillbirth as the Outcome and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) as the Primary Exposure of Interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nElectronic Health Records (EHR) contain detailed information about a patient’s medical history and can be helpful in understanding clinical outcomes among populations generally underrepresented in research, including pregnant individuals. A cesarean delivery is a clinical outcome often considered in studies as an adverse pregnancy outcome, when in reality there are circumstances in which a cesarean delivery is considered the safest or best choice given the patient’s medical history, situation, and comfort. Rather than consider all cesarean deliveries to be negative outcomes, it is important to examine other risk factors that may contribute to a cesarean delivery being an adverse event. Looking at emergency admissions can be a useful way to ascertain whether or not a cesarean delivery is part of an adverse event. This study utilizes EHR data from Penn Medicine to assess patient characteristics and pregnancy-related conditions as risk factors for an emergency admission at the time of delivery. After adjusting for pregnancy number and cesarean number for each patient, preterm birth increased risk of an emergency admission, and patients younger than 25, or identifying as Black/African American, Asian, or Other/Mixed, had an increased risk. Later pregnancies and repeat cesareans decreased the risk of an emergency delivery, and White, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients were at decreased risk. The same risk factors and trends were found among cesarean deliveries, except that Asian patients did not have an increased risk, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients did not have a reduced risk in this group.\n\n\n\n2021 PSB Poster (letter)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bone is a composite material made up of an inorganic (hydroxyapatite mineral) phase, a proteinaceous organic phase, and water. Comprising 90% of bone’s organic phase, type I collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. Both hydroxyapatite and collagen contribute to bone mechanical properties, and because bone is a hierarchical material, changes in properties of either phase can influence bulk mechanical properties of the tissue and bone structure. Type I collagen in bone is synthesized by osteoblasts as a helical structure formed from three polypeptide chains of amino acids. These molecules are staggered into an array and the resulting collagen fibrils are stabilized by crosslinks. Enzymatic crosslinking can be limited by compounds such as β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and result in a crosslink deficiency characterizing a disease known as lathyrism. BAPN acts by irreversibly binding to the active site of the lysyl oxidase enzyme, blocking the formation of new crosslinks and the maturation of pre-existing immature crosslinks. Understanding how changes in bone properties on a cellular level transcend levels of bone hierarchy provides an opportunity to detect or diagnose bone disease before disease-related changes are expressed at the organ or tissue level. This dissertation studies the in vitro effect of BAPN-induced enzymatic crosslink reduction on osteoblast-produced collagen nanostructure, mechanical properties, crosslink ratio, and expression of genes related to type I collagen synthesis and crosslinking. The work also explores the effect of mechanical loading via applied substrate strain on these properties to investigate its potential compensatory impact."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objective: To investigate the association between individual-level and neighborhood-level risk factors and severe maternal morbidity.\nMethods: This was a retrospective cohort study of all pregnancies delivered between 2010 and 2017 in the University of Pennsylvania Health System. International Classification of Diseases codes classified severe maternal morbidity according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Logistic regression modeling evaluated individual-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, such as maternal age and preeclampsia diagnosis. Additionally, we used spatial autoregressive modeling to assess Census-tract, neighborhood-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity such as violent crime and poverty.\nResults: Overall, 63,334 pregnancies were included, with a severe maternal morbidity rate of 2.73%, or 272 deliveries with severe maternal morbidity per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations. In our multivariable model assessing individual-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, the magnitude of risk was highest for patients with a cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.50, 95% CI 3.15-3.89), stillbirth (aOR 4.60, 95% CI 3.31-6.24), and preeclampsia diagnosis (aOR 2.71, 95% CI 2.41-3.03). Identifying as White was associated with lower odds of severe maternal morbidity at delivery (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.87). In our final multivariable model assessing neighborhood-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, the rate of severe maternal morbidity increased by 2.4% (95% CI 0.37-4.4%) with every 10% increase in the percentage of individuals in a Census tract who identified as Black or African American when accounting for the number of violent crimes and percentage of people identifying as White.\nConclusion: Both individual-level and neighborhood-level risk factors were associated with severe maternal morbidity. These factors may contribute to rising severe maternal morbidity rates in the United States. Better characterization of risk factors for severe maternal morbidity is imperative for the design of clinical and public health interventions seeking to lower rates of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality."

    "text": "Menarche is the first occurrence of a woman’s menstruation, an event that symbolizes reproductive capacity and the transition from childhood into womanhood. The global average age for menarche is 12 years and this has been declining in recent years. Many factors that affect the timing menarche in girls could be affected by climate change. A systematic literature review was performed regarding the timing of menarche and four publication databases were interrogated: EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews. Themes were identified from 112 articles and related to environmental causes of perturbations in menarche (either early or late), disease causes and consequences of perturbations, and social causes and consequences. Research from climatology was incorporated to describe how climate change events, including increased hurricanes, avalanches/mudslides/landslides, and extreme weather events could alter the age of menarche by disrupting food availability or via increased toxin/pollutant release. Overall, our review revealed that these perturbations in the timing of menarche are likely to increase the disease burden for women in four key areas: mental health, fertility-related conditions, cardiovascular disease, and bone health. In summary, the climate does have the potential to impact women’s health through perturbation in the timing of menarche and this, in turn, will affect women’s risk of disease in future."

We replicated all five disease/conditions implicated by PFAS exposure, including hypercholesterolemia, thyroid disease, proteinuria, kidney disease and colitis, either directly or via closely related diagnoses. Using EHRs coupled with informatics enables the health impacts of environmental disasters to be more easily studied in large cohorts versus traditional methods that rely on interviews and expensive serum-based testing. By reducing cost and increasing the diversity of individuals included in studies, we can overcome many of the hurdles faced by previous studies, including a lack of racial and ethnic diversity.

    "title": "Medication-Wide Association Study Using Electronic Health Record Data of Prescription Medication Exposure and Multifetal Pregnancies: Retrospective Study",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background. Medication-wide association studies (MWAS) have been applied to assess the risk of individual prescription use and a wide range of health outcomes, including cancer, acute myocardial infarction, acute liver failure, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal ulcers. Current literature on the use of preconception and periconception medication and its association with the risk of multiple gestation pregnancies (eg, monozygotic and dizygotic) is largely based on assisted reproductive technology (ART) cohorts. However, among non-ART pregnancies, it is unknown whether other medications increase the risk of multifetal pregnancies.\nObjective. This study aimed to investigate the risk of multiple gestational births (eg., twins and triplets) following preconception and periconception exposure to prescription medications in patients who delivered at Penn Medicine.\nMethods. We used electronic health record data between 2010 and 2017 on patients who delivered babies at Penn Medicine, a health care system in the Greater Philadelphia area. We explored 3 logistic regression models: model 1 (no adjustment); model 2 (adjustment for maternal age); and model 3—our final logistic regression model (adjustment for maternal age, ART use, and infertility diagnosis). In all models, multiple births (MBs) were our outcome of interest (binary outcome), and each medication was assessed separately as a binary variable. To assess our MWAS model performance, we defined ART medications as our gold standard, given that these medications are known to increase the risk of MB.\nResults. Of the 63,334 distinct deliveries in our cohort, only 1877 pregnancies (2.96%) were prescribed any medication during the preconception and first trimester period. Of the 123 medications prescribed, we found 26 (21.1%) medications associated with MB (using nominal P values) and 10 (8.1%) medications associated with MB (using Bonferroni adjustment) in fully adjusted model 3. We found that our model 3 algorithm had an accuracy of 85% (using nominal P values) and 89% (using Bonferroni-adjusted P values).\nConclusions. Our work demonstrates the opportunities in applying the MWAS approach with electronic health record data to explore associations between preconception and periconception medication exposure and the risk of MB while identifying novel candidate medications for further study. Overall, we found 3 novel medications linked with MB that could be explored in further work; this demonstrates the potential of our method to be used for hypothesis generation.\n\n\n\nA graphical overview of the medication-wide association study analyses on multiple birth."

    "text": "Type I collag een morphology can be characterized using fibril D-spacing, a metric which describes the periodicity of repeating bands of gap and overlap regions of collagen molecules arranged into collagen fibrils. This fibrillar structure is stabilized by enzymatic crosslinks initiated by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step which can be disrupted using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Murine in vivo studies have confirmed effects of BAPN on collagen nanostructure and the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of these effects in vitro by measuring D-spacing, evaluating the ratio of mature to immature crosslinks, and quantifying gene expression of type I collagen and LOX. Osteoblasts were cultured in complete media, and differentiated using ascorbic acid, in the presence or absence of 0.25mM BAPN-fumarate. The matrix produced was imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 2D Fast Fourier transforms were performed to extract D-spacing from individual fibrils. The experiment was repeated for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The D-spacing distribution of collagen produced in the presence of BAPN was shifted toward higher D-spacing values, indicating BAPN affects the morphology of collagen produced in vitro, supporting aforementioned in vivo experiments. In contrast, no difference in gene expression was found for any target gene, suggesting LOX inhibition does not upregulate the LOX gene to compensate for the reduction in aldehyde formation, or regulate expression of genes encoding type I collagen. Finally, the mature to immature crosslink ratio decreased with BAPN treatment and was linked to a reduction in peak percent area of mature crosslink hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP). In conclusion, in vitro treatment of osteoblasts with low levels of BAPN did not induce changes in genes encoding LOX or type I collagen, but led to an increase in collagen D-spacing as well as a decrease in mature crosslinks."

    "text": "Enzymatic crosslinks stabilize type I collagen and are catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step interrupted through β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) exposure. This study evaluated dose-dependent effects of BAPN on osteoblast gene expression of type I collagen, LOX, and genes associated with crosslink formation. The second objective was to characterize collagen produced in vitro after exposure to BAPN, and to explore changes to collagen properties under continuous cyclical substrate strain. To evaluate dose-dependent effects, osteoblasts were exposed to a range of BAPN dosages (0–10 mM) for gene expression analysis and cell proliferation. Results showed significant upregulation of BMP-1, POST, and COL1A1 and change in cell proliferation. Results also showed that while the gene encoding LOX was unaffected by BAPN treatment, other genes related to LOX activation and matrix production were upregulated. For the loading study, the combined effects of BAPN and mechanical loading were assessed. Gene expression was quantified, atomic force microscopy was used to extract elastic properties of the collagen matrix, and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy was used to assess collagen secondary structure for enzymatic crosslinking analysis. BAPN upregulated BMP-1 in static samples and BAPN combined with mechanical loading downregulated LOX when compared to control-static samples. Results showed a higher indentation modulus in BAPN-loaded samples compared to control-loaded samples. Loading increased the mature-to-immature crosslink ratios in control samples, and BAPN increased the height ratio in static samples. In summary, effects of BAPN (upregulation of genes involved in crosslinking, mature/immature crosslinking ratios, upward trend in collagen elasticity) were mitigated by mechanical loading."

    "text": "Asking around\nIn the interest of making an informed decision, I asked a few instructors to share a bit about their experience with the certification process before I made the commitment.\n\n🇺🇸 Stephan Kadauke is a colleague I met through the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia R User group. Specifically at an Intro to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse workshop led by Alison Hill.\n\nI met these wonderful people through the R-Ladies Global Slack workspace:\n\n🇦🇷 Yanina Bellini Saibene shared her experience with this process in her blog post Obtaining RStudio certification. A shared path.\n🇧🇴 🇳🇱 Paloma Rojas-Saunero shared her view as a Ph.D. candidate with experience teaching R in R-Ladies workshops and as a teaching assistant in biostatistics courses.\n🇰🇪 Shelmith Kariuki speaks to her experience in her blog post The RStudio Certification Process.\n\n\nHere’s what folks had to say!\nHighlights are shared with the authors’ permission and my gratitude to them.\n\nWhat made you want to pursue the certification?\n\nOne, it gave me incentive to read R for Data Science cover to cover which I had been meaning to do for a while. Two, I’m teaching R and the certification gives me some gravitas to do that. Three, it forced me to critically think about cognitive load theory, concept mapping, and lesson development, all of which are super useful when you actually have to develop lessons. –Stephan\n\n\nI pursued the certification for a few reasons. First because I am really enthusiastic about teaching and I love the tidyverse, so I wanted to find opportunities of teaching it outside my university. Second because I feel that RStudio is growing so fast on teaching materials that sharing with other instructors would be a great way to always keep updated. And last but not least, I was also encouraged by the idea of going through the process with Yanina Bellini Saibene and other amazing women as she discusses in her blog post. –Paloma\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of the training itself, particularly the pedagogical aspects?\n\nThe training is top notch. In my mind, Greg Wilson is the #1 authority when it comes to teaching programming and R in particular. –Stephan\n\n\nI think the best part is to take and learn the pedagogical aspect. Greg Wilson is an awesome trainer and you will love as a student all the tools and techniques that he teaches you. For learning this, the course is already worth it. All the content is more developed in the book Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson if you want to look it over. –Yanina\n\n\nAbout the training, it was mind blowing, it changed my view of teaching not only programming but everything. Greg’s book is amazing and the way he teaches is outstanding. I learned so much. –Paloma\n\n\n\nHave you been able to implement what you learned in some way either at work or elsewhere?\n\nYes! As you probably saw, I’m teaching the intro to R course for R/Medicine. And I’ve been teaching a similar course to doctors, in addition to some other teaching sessions that I’ve done for the CHOP R User group and/or medical resident teaching. –Stephan\n\n\nYes! Immediately. I delivered 3 in-person courses after training and more than 15 courses on-line using all the pedagogical tools. I also co-founded Metadocencia where we share practical tools to help teachers teach online (volunteer-run and free) using these principles learned in the training. I also use some of the tools for my work as the chief of a research group for some meetings and identifying the target of some of our development (especially concept maps and learner personas). –Yanina\n\n\nI think I use what I learned so far even when I am preparing my work presentations, when developing any type of class, event, book club, etc. Overall it was an experience that made me reflect a lot on how teaching is usually done, how is my teaching so far and an inspiration about the teacher I want to be. –Paloma"

I tend to take such strong endorsements with a spoonful of skepticism and (spoiler alert) I’m happy to say I fully agree with everything that was said by those above. In that spirit, I’ll add my own glowing recommendation:\n\nGreg Wilson is truly a programming pedagogy expert, and an incredibly kind human being. I’m grateful to have learned from him within the context of the certification, and appreciate being able to continue learning from his example in a variety of other contexts.\n\nNevertheless, I’m glad I got to do a gut-check beforehand when I attended the RStudio Instructor Certification Panel hosted by the MiR Community and facilitated by Dorris Scott and Danielle Smalls-Perkins. You’ll notice Yanina and Shelmith were two of the panelists! Hearing from this panel was the last piece of the puzzle I needed to feel like pursuing the certification was an enthusiastic yes."

For anything that didn’t fully sink in, I consulted Teaching Tech Together.\nYou can find all materials for my teaching demonstration on GitHub. They include the slides below and this R Markdown file that I used to incorporate live coding into the lesson.\nI found an excellent reference for a demonstration lesson in Florencia D’Andrea’s post Two examples of iteration with purrr - Class for the RStudio certification.\nIt comes highly recommended that someone take a look at each one of our lessons before it ships out because it seems it’s common not to realize we’ve packed too much in! Yanina was kind enough to sit through my lesson as a learner and provided fantastic feedback. Some of the things I was able to work on before my teaching exam included providing context for the lesson at the beginning (asking the learner to download the file, introducing the lesson in the context of a workshop, etc.) and talking through all my key strokes during the live coding portions. Thanks again Yani!"

Yanina joined us for some of the sessions to lend us her expertise and provide tips and tricks!\nOne of the recommendations Yanina made was to explore the RStudio Primers for any topic we wanted to practice. For me that meant iteration using purrr’s map functions. After the iteration primer and the companion R for Data Science chapter, I felt like I could iterate all day every day.\nIn real life, both the written portion of the teaching exam and the Tidyverse exam are very much like the sample exams provided on the RStudio Education blog. You can find those here:\n\nSample exam v1.0 (February 2020): Instructor Certification Exams\nSample exam v2.0 (August 2020): More sample exams\n\nIf you’re a member of the MiR Community and like the idea of studying with some structure and friendly accountability, join us for the study group!

    "section": "Why port to Quarto?",
    "text": "Why port to Quarto?\nQuarto is a new and powerful technical publishing system in active development, natively friendly to a variety of programming languages and IDEs. There are countless features available in Quarto that I was interested in having access to in my website, so I’ll list just my top five:\n\nFlexibility in design. Quarto offers options for website navigation (top navigation vs. side navigation), “about” pages like the postcard landing pages that a lot of folks use in their distill sites, listing pages that are generated from a list of documents, among others. These components would act like modules that I could combine to design a site that truly fit my needs.\nFlexibility in content layout. With Quarto I would gain the ability to organize content in ways I hadn’t even dreamt of. Tables and figures could be laid out across multiple columns and rows as sub-tables and sub-figures of a panel. How much of the page the content took up would be up to me. Content could even go in the margin! 🤩 \nFreezing computations. Quarto would give me the option to freeze posts containing executable code. This was huge for me, because updating my blogdown site always produced a little bit of anxiety. I used to worry that blogdown might try to re-render old R Markdown blog posts and break things! 😱\nSite search. With content spread out over blog posts, talks, publications, and projects, I wanted site visitors (including myself!) to be able to keyword search for something in particular. Tags and categories in blogdown would get me part of the way there, but Quarto offers built-in search capability.\nEmbedding computations. Ok this is a feature that I learned about a week ago at posit::conf(2023) from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s talk “Reproducible Manuscripts with Quarto.” Mine demo’d pulling a table from a .qmd file and a figure from an .ipynb file into the same manuscript .qmd file, without having to execute the source code again! 👀 This is a game changer for anyone compiling results from computations performed in different files, and in my personal site I could see it coming in handy if I have a series of blog posts with outputs that I want to cross-reference. Currently we can only embed computations from Jupyter notebook files, but hopefully we’ll be able to embed .qmd computations in Quarto v1.4! 🤞🏽\nI mean, it’s pretty cool that content can go in the margin, right??  It could even be a picture: The book page reads verdere expedities which is Dutch for “further expeditions”"

    "text": "The cost of porting\nGaining the aforementioned Quarto functionality did not come without a cost. To me, the biggest cost was the aesthetics – the Hugo Apéro theme is quite lovely! – but I customized my Quarto site enough to reflect the design aspects I loved the most. More on styling later. Some other costs included:\n\n\nLoss of the sidebar layout. The Apéro theme has options for adding a nicely styled sidebar that I had been using for my blog. It included a featured image and details about the individual post like tags, categories, length, etc. All of this information is available in Quarto posts, it’s just organized a little differently.\nExample of the sidebar\n\n\n\n\nLoss of Utterances comments. Any interactions with folks through Utteranc.es comments did not transfer over, and I’ll miss them. The few comments on my site have been very kind (see example below) and I’ve really enjoy reading them!\nExample of Utterances comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Oct. 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Emily Riederer, I’m happy to report this is a non-issue! See her tips in the comments at the end of the post, or on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nHugo Apéro collections. The Apéro theme had a way of bundling together posts that were related into a collection of posts. Garrick and I used this feature for our user!2021 xaringan workshop and it worked well to organize learning materials for different sections of our workshop. If I wanted something like this in the future, I would probably use Quarto’s sidebar navigation feature like Andrew Bray did in his Rmd to Quarto workshop for rstudio::conf(2022).\nName pronunciation on the About page. Apéro had a built-in option for adding an audio clip under your name that you could use to help people learn how your name is pronounced. I never used this feature myself, but if I wanted to, I could look to Emil Hvitfeldt’s site as an example.\nRedirects. The Apéro theme gave me the option to define the combination of date information and URL slugs for each of my posts, and I had them set up as year-slug (e.g., blog/2023-hello-quarto). Quarto does not offer that functionality and strictly creates URLs for posts based on the filepath (e.g., blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto). In order to continue using my year-month-day-slug naming convention for my post folders, I had to set up redirects from the old URLs to the new ones so that there wouldn’t be broken links sprinkled throughout the internet. More on redirects later."

I used an about page layout for both my home and about pages, and listing pages to generate a list of blog posts, talks, publications, and projects. There was also some custom CSS involved, but we haven’t gotten to that part of the blog post yet wink 😉 Dear reader, it’s at this point in my blog post drafting that I start realizing that what was meant to be a brief post is turning into a novel (sigh)\nOne of the aspects I liked about my Apéro site was that the About page highlighted the most recent posts from the blog, talk, publication, and project groups. In my Quarto site, I achieved this by including a one-entry listing grid for each group on my About page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThese listing cards looked great on a wide screen but as the screen got narrower (think mobile device) the listing cards just became narrower and narrower 😂.

I saw a great example on Michael McCarthy’s Tidy Tales blog, site and did a little repo-diving to get ideas on how to organize the content. I ended up using the Bootstrap CSS Grid to layout the content exactly how I wanted to. See what I mean about Quarto offering a lot of flexibility in content layout?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBones of the contact page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontact.qmd\n\n\n&lt;!-- start grid --&gt;\n::: {.grid} \n\n&lt;!-- column for the body text --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-5}\n\n# Send me a note\n\n&lt; Body text&gt;\n\n&lt; HTML code for social media icons &gt;\n\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for spacing --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-1}\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for the form --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-6}\n\n&lt; HTML embed code provided by Formspree &gt;\n\n:::\n\n:::\n&lt;!-- end grid --&gt;\n\n source code"

    "text": "Adapting old posts\nYAML fields\nOk so once I figured out how to incorporate all of the structural elements I wanted, I had to deal with the (relatively small) challenge of porting my old posts to Quarto. Quarto was designed to be compatible with existing R Markdown documents, but I didn’t actually want it trying to re-render old R Markdown files so I had Quarto ignore those completely2 and render the Markdown version of each post instead3. There were also a handful of YAML fields that I had to remove or modify to play nicely with Quarto:\n\nRemove layout: (e.g., layout: single-sidebar)\nRemove publishDate\n\nRemove lastUpdated\n\nRemove featured (e.g., featured: yes)\nMerge categories with tags and keep tags\n\nAdd image (e.g. image: featured.png)\nPartials\nIf you’ve used Apéro you might have come to love the cute button links created from the links field in the YAML, like the one at the top of this post, pointing to the Quarto docs.\nlinks:\n- icon: journal-text\n  name: Quarto Docs\n  url: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\nWell, these button links are not ready-made by Quarto, but lucky for me (us!), Garrick figured out a way to bring them in right where we I need them. I repo-dived and found that he modified an HTML partial for title blocks, which controls the layout and styling of the post title, description, and tags, shown at the top of the page.\nThe original title block partial has sections controlling the placement and styling of text provided in the title, subtitle, authors, date, and abstract fields of the document YAML.\nAs an example, line 2 might read:If there’s something in the title field of the YAML, give it a level 1 heading and style it with CSS class .title\n\n\ngithub.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/src/resources/formats/html/pandoc/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\"&gt;\n$if(title)$&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;$title$&lt;/h1&gt;$endif$\n$if(subtitle)$\n&lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;$subtitle$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$for(author)$\n&lt;p class=\"author\"&gt;$author$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endfor$\n\n$if(date)$\n&lt;p class=\"date\"&gt;$date$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$if(abstract)$\n&lt;div class=\"abstract\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"abstract-title\"&gt;$abstract-title$&lt;/div&gt;\n$abstract$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n&lt;/header&gt;\n\nThe modified partial  includes some additional sections but I’ll break down the one for links.\nThere’s more styling going on in the modified partial, but starting on line 6, the structure for the link buttons is effectively:If the links field is populated in the YAML, create an HTML container styled by some CSS, and give it some specific HTML properies.Then, for each sub-item of the links field: create a hyperlink from the url sub-item, apply some CSS classes to create the button, add a Bootstrap icon defined by the icon sub-item, and finally add hyperlink text defined by the name sub-item.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\" class=\"quarto-title-block default page-columns\"&gt;\n...\n$if(links)$\n&lt;div class=\"mt-4 d-flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-1 justify-content-left justify-content-sm-start\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Links\"&gt;\n$for(links)$\n&lt;a href=\"$links.url$\" class=\"btn btn-secondary text-capitalize\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"bi bi-$links.icon$ me-1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;$links.name$&lt;/a&gt;\n$endfor$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n...\n&lt;/header&gt;"

    "section": "Styling the site",
    "text": "Styling the site\nSCSS variables\nI may have published my brand new Quarto site in the fall of 2023, but I had actually taken my first go at porting it from Apéro in the fall of 2022. In an attempt to replicate the styling of my old site I tried to strong-arm my Quarto site into using tachyons4, and I wrote way too much custom CSS in the process 😩.\nSomething didn’t feel right about it, so I took a break and came back to my in-progress Quarto site several months later – outside of the Quarto release craze, and with the perspective that I wanted to work with the built-in theming capabilities, rather than against them 😌. This time around I leaned into the Bootstrap SCSS variables, and added custom styling as needed.\nTo be more specific, I created a custom theme 5, and populated it with definitions for some of the built-in Bootstrap Sass variables. If you poke around my custom theme, you will notice that some colors are defined by color variables that start with $spc-. These are variables pointing to colors that I’ve defined elsewhere, and they can be replaced with a hex code of your choosing! 🎨\n\n\nassets/silvia-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n// Colors\n$primary:                    $spc-primary-light;\n$secondary:                  $spc-secondary;\n\nThe Sass variables listed in the documentation got me pretty far, but there were still elements of my site using default colors and styling that I wanted to change. So I repo-dived to learn about additional Quarto Bootstrap variables and rules:\n\nBootstrap variables: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-variables.scss\n\nBootstrap rules: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-rules.scss\n\n\nTo give you an example, someone in the Quarto Discussions forum asked how to set the color of block quotes, figure captions, and outlines, something not defined in the documentation. One of the replies suggested using the browser’s inspector to find the CSS rule applied to the element in question, we’ll say the figure caption, and then looking at how Quarto implemented that rule. I’ll make that process a little more explicit here and use the figure caption as an example:\n\nUse the browser inspector to highlight a figure caption\nThe inspector will reveal that the element is styled by CSS class .figure-caption\nRun a keyword search for “figure-caption” in the Bootstrap variables file. This will yield no results 🤔\n\nRun the same keyword search in the Bootstrap rules file – success! We have a clue, which is that .figure-caption is styled by a variable named body-secondary 🔍\n.panel-caption,\n.figure-caption,\n.subfigure-caption,\n.table-caption,\nfigcaption.quarto-float-caption,\ncaption {\n  font-size: 0.9rem;\n  @include body-secondary;\n}\n\n\nDefine your own body-secondary color variable in your custom theme file\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n$body-secondary: #6C757D;\n\n\nEnjoy the fruits of your labor as a CSS detective 🕵🏽‍♀️\nIndividual page styling\nIn some cases, I wanted to style individual pages differently than I was styling my entire site. Poking around Garrick’s repo (again!), I learned that you can reference CSS stylesheets in the YAML of any particular document. I used this approach to separately style my Home, About, and listing pages.\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nexecute: \n  freeze: false\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n\n\n\nindex.qmd  source code\n\n\nassets/index.css  source code\n\nBackground image for title blocks\nOk one of the aesthetic pieces I was excited to add to my Quarto site that I didn’t have in my old site is a featured image at the top of each post. I was inspired by Matt Worthington’s site while I was reading one of his excellent blog posts on a workflow for interactive maps in R – I loved that the title block included an image in the background! 🤩\nAfter some web inspecting and repo-diving in Matt’s website repo I came up with some styling that I could apply to the title block of each post. It took modifying the title block partial described earlier, and adding some CSS to my custom theme.\nFor styling that I wanted to apply uniformly to all post title blocks, I created a .figured-image CSS class in my custom theme:\nDon’t miss the code annotations for this code chunk! 👀 Such a cool feature!\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n  // style background image on posts\n  .featured-image {\n1    background-size: cover;\n2    background-position: center;\n3    color: white;\n4    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(0,38,66,0.75);\n  }\n\n\n1\n\nHave the image cover the background\n\n2\n\nCenter the image\n\n3\n\nMake the overlaying text color white\n\n4\n\nAdd shadowing that gives the appearance of a dark overlay\n\n\nAlright, but why didn’t I use a background-image property to define the image? If I define the background image in my .featured-image class then that is the image that’s going to show up in all of the posts across my site. I want the title block of each post to display the featured image belonging to each individual post. That’s where the partial comes back in.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;div \nid=\"title-block-header-title\" \nclass=\"quarto-title page-columns page-full page-layout-full featured-image p-4\" \nstyle=\"background-image: url(featured.png), url(featured.jpg), url(../featured.jpg);\"&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAlong with some other CSS classes, the div container for the title block is styled with the featured-image class defined earlier, using the class= property. In addition, the div itself is styled using the style= property, and that’s where I defined the background image. The partial will look for a featured image of some kind either in the same folder as the post, or in the parent folder, and display it in the background of the title block.\nThis is a hacky way of getting what I really want which is for the partial to check for a featured image in the order I specify and then just stop once it finds one. As it stands right now, the styling attempts to layer on all three images, with the first image on the top and the last image on the bottom. This means that I get a warning every time I preview or render my site because the partial can’t find one or two of the other urls, but I’m ok with that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample warning\n\n\n\n/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/featured.png (404: Not Found)"

These redirects primarily have the task of redirecting my rbind.io domain to my custom domain silviacanelon.com.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;-\n  readr::read_table(here::here(\"static\", \"_manualredirects.txt\"),\n                    col_names = FALSE) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(redirect = paste0(X1, \" \", X2, \" \", X3))\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;- manual_redirects$redirect\n\nhead(manual_redirects)\n\n\n[1] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/authors/silvia/avatar.png https://silviacanelon.com/about/sidebar/avatar.png 301!\"\n[2] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/post/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[3] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/blog/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[4] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/talk/* https://silviacanelon.com/talk/:splat 301!\"                                \n[5] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/project/* https://silviacanelon.com/project/:splat 301!\"                          \n[6] \"http://silvia.rbind.io/* https://silviacanelon.com/:splat 301!\"                                           \n\n\nListing subdirectories\nThe next step defines a function that obtains a list of subdirectories, iterates it over the four groups of posts in my site (blog posts, talks, publications, and projects), and compiles the files into a data frame.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# function: obtain list of post paths\nlist_paths &lt;- function(folder) {\n  posts &lt;-\n    list.dirs(\n    path = c(here::here(folder)),\n    full.names = FALSE,\n    recursive = FALSE\n    ) |&gt; \n    tibble::as_tibble_col(column_name = \"path\")  |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(folder = folder)\n}\n\n# define post folders\nfolders &lt;- c(\"blog\", \"project\", \"publication\", \"talk\")\n\n# list post paths by folder\nposts &lt;- purrr::map(folders, list_paths) |&gt; purrr::list_rbind()\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDefining redirects\nThis next chunk removes the month and day from year-month-day-slug so that I’m left with shorter paths with the format year-slug, and uses these paths and the folders they are housed in to create redirects.\nThe resulting redirects will point the short year-slug link to this blog post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-hello-quarto\nTo the longer year-month-day-slug Quarto link to this post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto\n\n# extract short paths and create redirects\nposts &lt;- \n  posts |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # extract the year-slugs\n    short_path = stringr::str_remove(path, \"(?!\\\\d{4}-)\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}-(?!\\\\d)\"),\n    # create short paths\n    short_path = paste0(folder, \"/\", short_path),\n    # create lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file\n    redirects = paste0(\"/\", short_path, \" \", \"/\", folder, \"/\", path)\n    )\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWriting redirects file\nThe last step takes the redirects from the data frame produced in the previous step, combines them with the manual redirects, and writes them to a new text file _redirects. This file is written into the _site folder where my Quarto site is rendered, and where Netlify will know to find it.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# extract redirects\nredirects &lt;- posts$redirects\n\n# combine with manual redirects\nredirects_combined &lt;- c(manual_redirects, redirects)\n\n# write the _redirect file\nwriteLines(redirects_combined, here::here(\"_site\", \"_redirects\"))"

    "text": "With Alison Hill’s Up and Running with Blogdown post! Super helpful, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‘up and running with lots of water breaks’ because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime.\n\nFor example, prior to Academic version 4.6, custom CSS was added using the plugins_css option in params.toml, but in current version 4.8, the theme supports SCSS (a superset of CSS) and a custom.scss file is added in the assets/scss/ folder.\n\nThe going futher section in Alison’s post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom CSS file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in my custom SCSS file.\nAlison’s CSS helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic’s light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors for the most part and they just didn’t go.\n\nSo I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in params.toml until I could figure out how to customize my stylesheet accordingly. That time has come because it turns out it’s pretty straightforward!\nThe Blogdown book does an excellent job summarizing what you need to know about CSS. This post builds on that a little by incorporating features made possible by SCSS including variables."

The recommended color is #121212\nAs you layer components, surfaces with a higher elevation (closer to the hypothetical ‘light source’) should be lighter than those below it to create a visual hierarchy. This can be achieved by applying a semi-transparent white overlay to the primary dark gray surface.\n\n\n\nThe primary text color for dark themes should not be 100% opaque white (i.e. #FFFFFF) because it can appear to bleed or blur against dark backgrounds and be difficult to read.\nText hierarchy is established by controlling the opacity, for example:\n\nHigh emphasis text is white with 87% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87)\nMedium emphasis is white with 60% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60)\nDisabled text is white with 38% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.38)\n\nTo meet WCAG AA standard, there must be a 4.5:1 contrast level between the body text and the dark theme surface at the highest/lightest elevation. The contrast level is 7:1 for the WCAG AAA standard."

    "section": "Cards",
    "text": "Cards\nThe first step is to extract information about the Trello cards themselves. This information is contained within a list of data frames and requires flattening which makes the nested hierarchical data structure into a flatter structure by assigning each of the nested variables its own column as much as possible. Then, the most important variables are selected as cards_trim before moving on to extracting label information.\n# selecting cards information\ncards &lt;- trello$cards # list of 1\n\n# flattening\ncards_flat &lt;- flatten(cards) #list of 37\n\n# tibble time\ncards_flat_tbl &lt;- as_tibble(cards_flat) # 32 obs of 37 variables\nglimpse(cards_flat_tbl)\n\n# selecting wanted variables\ncards_trim &lt;- cards_flat_tbl %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, idList, dateLastActivity, name, desc, dueComplete, due,\n         labels, attachments, shortUrl, closed) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(dateLastActivity))\n\nLabels\nRelevant information about the labels is selected and the unnest function is used to flatten because labels is a list of data frames. Again, I found Kan’s post helpful here! Particularly for saving the label details as a character list, which is helpful later on. Once we get to Airtable it’ll be important that label information for each card be structured as a simple list of words (i.e. label1, label2, label3). We get close once the labels are contained within a character list labelList, but there are still “c”s and parentheses that need to be removed. String manipulation is something I’m still learning about so the code below is far from elegant!\n# extracting labels details\nlabels_info &lt;- cards_trim %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, labels) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;% # no arguments because the nested items don't have names\n  rename(labelName = name) %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, labelName) %&gt;%\n  group_by(id, idShort) %&gt;%\n  summarize(labelList = list(labelName)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList = as.character(labelList)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList, pattern = \"\\\"\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\"c\\\\(\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\"\\\\)\")) %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\nknitr::kable(labels_info %&gt;% head(n = 3L))\n\n# joining back with main cards data frame\nct_labels &lt;- left_join(cards_trim %&gt;% select(-labels), labels_info %&gt;% select(-labelList))\n\n\nAttachments\nThe next step is to download all of the items attached to the cards onto a local folder. I found this StackOverflow post really helpful. When I tried this out on my own Trello board I also found that I couldn’t download the few attachments I had made from my local drive. This StackOverflow post helped me figure out how to flag and catch these download errors so that I could create a list of the urls with “attachment errors” that I could follow up with manually.\n# expanding the attachment lists into separate url records\natt_urls &lt;- ct_labels %&gt;%\n  select(idShort, attachments) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;%\n  select(idShort, url) %&gt;%\n  mutate(url = as.character(url),\n         attachmentError = 'FALSE')\nknitr::kable(att_urls %&gt;% head(n = 3L))\n\n# creating directory for attachments\ndirAttachments &lt;- \"attachments/\"\ndir.create(dirAttachments)\n\n# downloading urls and checking for errors using try()\nfor (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){\n  locAttachments &lt;-\n        paste(dirAttachments, \"/\", att_urls$idShort[i], \"_\", basename(att_urls$url[i]), sep = \"\")\n  step_to_try &lt;- try(attachment_check &lt;- download.file(att_urls$url[i], destfile = locAttachments))\n  if(\"try-error\" %in% class(step_to_try)) {\n    cat(\"Error row: \", i, \"\\n\", \"Error message: \", step_to_try[1], sep = \"\")\n    att_urls$attachmentError[i] = 'TRUE'\n  }\n}\nThe following selects the attachment records with errors, renames somes variables, and exports the data frame as a CSV.\n# preparing data frame for export to CSV\nattachment_errors &lt;- att_urls %&gt;%\n  filter(attachmentError == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  rename(Task_Id = idShort, Attachment_URL = url, Attachment_Error = attachmentError)\n\n# exporting to CSV\nwrite.csv(attachment_errors, file = \"attachment_errors.csv\")\n\nAside: If you have a lot of attachments per card, you may want to create a directory folder for each card. This for loop will get you there – use it instead of the one above:\n\n# creates individual directory folders for each card id\nfor (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){\n  dirAttachments &lt;- paste(dirFiles, \"attachments\", att_urls$idShort[i], sep = \"/\")\n  dir.create(dirAttachments) # creates directory for each unique card id\n  locAttachments &lt;- paste(dirAttachments, basename(url[i]), sep = \"/\")\n  download.file(url[i], destfile = locAttachments)\n}\nRecords in the main cards data frame are labeled “TRUE” within the attachments column if they have attachments and “FALSE” if they don’t.\n# converts the attachment column to a categorical variable in the main cards+labels data frame\nct_labels &lt;- ct_labels %&gt;%\n  mutate(attachments = ifelse(idShort %in% att_urls$idShort, TRUE, FALSE))"

Chartability was created by Frank Elavsky with input from the broader community and is the most thorough set of standards I’ve come across.\n\nØystein Moseng provides some basic practices to consider in the post 10 Guidelines for DataViz Accessibility. Among those included are these two which I don’t see covered as often:\n\nDo not rely on color alone to convey information. I’ve also heard this referred to as “color independence” and in some cases as “dual-encoding” of information\n\nPrefer simple, familiar visualizations over complex novelties.\n\n\n\n\n\nPie chart from Øystein’s post using color and (optional) patterns to encode information\n\n\n\n\nTalk at the Data Visualization Society’s Outlier conference earlier this year, by Frank Elavsky, Larene Le Gassick, and Sarah Fossheim: Are your visualizations excluding people?\n\nGuidelines by Amy Cesal on how to write alt text for data visualizations: Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nExample template from Amy’s post\n\n\n\nPost by Lisa Charlotte Muth on how to pick colors for your data viz that everyone can appreciate: How to pick more beautiful colors for your data visualizations - Datawrapper Blog\n\n\n\n\n\nExample from Charlotte’s post of two different approaches to improving a pie chart\n\n\n\nPost by Gareth Ford Williams from The Readability Group about how to make more informed font choices: A Guide to Understanding What Makes a Typeface Accessible\n\n\nRelated is a talk from The Readability Group sharing findings from a survey study about font preferences including 2000+ participants. Among these were participants with dyslexia characteristics and participants with poor near vision: Don’t Believe the Type!\n\n\n\n\n\nBar graph showing the frequency by which 20 different fonts were selected by study participants with strong poor near vision in comparison with users with no poor near vision.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Fossheim authored a post titled An intro to designing accessible data visualizations which uses real-word applications to demonstrate 10 different accessibility practices.\nSarah also provides a code-through showing how to make screenreader-friendly graphs using D3.js in their post How to create a screen reader accessible graph like Apple’s with D3.js\n\n\n\nAmber Thomas provides an example of how to make scrollytales more accessible in a piece created with Ofunne Amaka for The Pudding: The Naked Truth\n\n\n\nI'm excited to release this project for many reasons, but one among them is that I introduced lots of new (to me) #a11y features.

After web-scraping alt text from TidyTuesday tweets we found that only 3% of data viz tweets had alt text to accompany them (over the first 3 years of the TidyTuesday project). Links to the video recording, slides, and resources at https://github.com/spcanelon/csvConf2021. The talk includes guidelines on what makes effective alt text for data viz (complementary to those Amy Cesal includes in her post).\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from our presentation summarizing the most useful alt-text features found among 196 data viz tweets\n\n\n\nPost from RStudio on how to add alt text to visualizations produced in R Markdown using code chunk option fig.alt: New in knitr: Improved accessibility with image alt text. New in knitr v1.35: You can now add code chunk options inside the code chunk!\nExample updated thanks to a heads-up from Garrick:\n#| fig.cap: Bigger flippers, bigger bills \n#| fig.alt: Scatterplot of flipper length by bill length of 3 penguin species, where we show penguins with bigger flippers have bigger bills.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm,\n                            y = bill_length_mm,\n                            color = species)) +\n  geom_point(aes(shape = species), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\",\"cyan4\")) \n\n\nCode chunk adapted from the RStudio blog post\n\nThe previous example included fig.cap and fig.alt in the code chunk heading:\n\n\n\n\nBigger flippers, bigger bills\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggpattern R package developed by Mike FC supports filling ggplot2 geometries with patterns. If used judiciously, patterns can help make visualizations more accessible by providing an additional way to encode information without relying on color. Below is one example using ggpattern v0.2.2:\n\nlibrary(ggpattern)\n\npenguinColors &lt;- c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(species)) +\ngeom_bar_pattern(aes(fill = species,\n                    pattern = species,\n                    pattern_color = species),\n  fill = penguinColors,\n  alpha = 0.1,\n  linewidth = 1,\n  color = penguinColors,\n  pattern_color = penguinColors,\n  pattern_fill = penguinColors,\n  pattern_spacing = 0.025\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(legend.position = 'none')\n\n\n\nDifferent patterns mapped onto penguin species along with different colors\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Highcharter R package developed by Joshua Kunst adds interactivity to data viz using Highcharts JavaScript components designed with web accessibility in mind. The package has a learning curve, but lucky for us Mara Averick wrote an excellent series of blog posts on using the Highcharts accessibility module with {highcharter}.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive scatterplot from Mara’s post using color and shape to encode information about penguin species"

The cost conversion was done according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) provided by the World Bank. We wanted conference attendees and sponsors from different parts of the world to be able to participate in useR! and believed that this is a fair approach. It reflects the reality that attendees and sponsors from “High income” countries have a different purchasing power than those from “Low income” countries. The income categories and cost conversions are listed in a data table created in R that attendees can use to search for their country and attendee status if applicable (i.e. Industry, Academia, Student). They can use a built-in search bar, or filter according to a specific column.\nYou can read more about purchasing power parities, price level indexes, and PPP-based expenditures in the May 2020 World Bank post New results from the International Comparison Program shed light on the size of the global economy.\nThe Global Income Groups listed in the fee tables below were obtained using data from the 2017 International Comparison Program (ICP) which you can read more about in the report Purchasing Power Parities and the Size of World Economies: Results from the 2017 International Comparison Program.

Our study describes a cohort of TBI patients within the Penn Medicine health system and the distribution of TBI injury mechanisms and severity.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained Electronic Health Record data for 1,060,100 female patients treated at Penn Medicine inpatient or outpatient clinics from 2010-2017. We identified patients with TBI diagnoses using ICD-9/10 codes and the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD) definitions for TBI and TBI severity. The CDC/DOD codes for TBI were then manually annotated with mechanisms of TBI injury (e.g. Sport Mechanism of Injury, Collision or Crash, Foreign Body Object). The highest TBI severity category was noted for each patient and defined, in increasing severity, as “Mild,” “Moderate,” “Severe,” or “Penetrating.” We report the distribution of TBI mechanisms and severity among this patient population.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 4,392 patients with a total of 9,800 TBI diagnoses. The majority of diagnoses in the cohort were Mild (5,704; 58%), followed by Moderate (3,840; 39%), Severe (173; 1.8%), and Penetrating (83; 0.8%). The following are the six most common mechanisms observed to contribute to TBI diagnoses: “Injury,” “Mechanism of Injury,” “Accidents,” “Physical Accidents,” “Fall Mechanism of Injury,” and “Traffic Vehicle Accident.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study investigates the effect of sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease, on adverse pregnancy outcomes at Penn Medicine. The risk of a Cesarean section (C-section), preterm birth, stillbirth, pain crisis, blood transfusion, and hemorrhage during delivery were all found to be significantly correlated with race/ethnicity, sickle cell disease, the number of pain crises before delivery, and the number of blood transfusions before delivery. Multiple birth was also found to significantly increase the risk of these same outcomes.\n\nOral Presentations S17: March 23, 2021 11:30am-1pm ET\n\n\n\nBanner for the 2021 AMIA Informatics Summit (March 22-25)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Emily and I had the pleasure of presenting to the 2024 cohort of LDI Summer Undergraduate Mentored Research Program (SUMR). The materials for this interactive presentation were adapted from the Urban Institute’s series of Do No Harm guides, which focus on how to incorporate principles of equity into data collection, visualization, and communication. We concluded our talk by playing a game with the Scholars, encouraging them to use what they took away from the presentation to identify areas for improvement in a series of visualizations taken from published dashboards, papers, and other sources."

<div class="h1">Hey, I'm happy you're here</div>

Thanks for stopping by!

I work as a data scientist at the [Urban Health Lab](https://www.urbanhealthlab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include applications of biomedical and spatial data science in the public and population health fields. 

My current projects use electronic health record (EHR) and geospatial data to explore how the neighborhood environment and access to urban nature can impact the health of individuals in Philadelphia. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).

Get in touch by [sending me a note](/contact.qmd)! {{< fa feather-pointed >}}

## About me

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6 #about-me-1}

**Biomedical engineer turned informaticist, curious about all intersections of data and society.**

I enjoy using [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to optimize my data science workflow and have noticed it making guest appearances elsewhere in my life. I'm certified as an [RStudio Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/canelon+silvia/) and am passionate about R education and data literacy as ways to build power in communities. Keep up with my R tinkering in my [blog](/blog) and presentations in [talks](/talk).

::: {.g-col-6 #about-me-2}

Prior to joining the Urban Health Lab, I developed novel data mining methods to extract meaningful information from the EHR and study health outcomes and disparities in pregnant populations. I'm particularly interested in research that combines biomedical data science with open data sources in ways that prioritize health equity in communities.

# Personal website for Silvia Canelón

👋 Hello, and welcome to the repo for [my personal website](https://silvia.rbind.io)!

This version was made using the [Blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/index.html) R package and the [Hugo Apéro theme](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/).

I keep this repository public so that people can repo-dive and learn how to recreate what they like for their own site. This is how I learned! 🙌

In return, I only ask that you avoid duplicating my site for yourself without permission. A lot of thought went into making my site unique to me and your site deserves to reflect your own unique style too! You can find excellent documentation on how to create and customize your own Hugo Apéro site at https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/learn/. 🥂

Thanks and happy repo-diving! 🤿 <a href='https://app.netlify.com/sites/silvia/deploys'><img src='https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4d7dccd9-ec21-47eb-b218-34cb5b768883/deploy-status' align="right" height="20" alt='Netlify Status'/></a>

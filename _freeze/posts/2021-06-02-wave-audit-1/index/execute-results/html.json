You can find a summary of these findings in a WebAIM [blog post](https://webaim.org/blog/webaim-million-2021/) and detailed information in the [full report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag), both published on April 30, 2021.\n\nLearning about all of the ways that digital content is made inaccessible to people with disabilities has made me take inventory of the different ways that I have contributed to this problem (there was some shame to process here :see_no_evil:). \n\nThe magic of [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) has given me the gift of turning R code into a variety of HTML outputs including R notebooks, [xaringan presentation slides](/project/xaringan-nhs-r/), and websites like this one -- all of which I've been able to share freely online with others. This magic though (like all magic?) comes with limitations. R tools (and technology more broadly) can't automatically ensure that its various outputs are accessible to everyone. That's where we come in as software developers and content creators and take personal responsibility. At the risk of extending this metaphor too far, I'll finish by offering the framework that we all need to practice (accessibility) spells/skills in order to use these magical tools responsibly.\n\nAll of this to say that gaining awareness about accessibility as a way to create the more inclusive world that I want to live in has motivated me to do better. I even found myself excited to conduct accessibility audits on my digital content, including my personal website ([data viz](https://chartability.fizz.studio/) too)! \n\n### My audit results\n\nI relied on WebAIM's [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/) to help me get started. I installed the [Firefox extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) to conduct my audit. Here's what I found at a high level, and each section of the post contains an itemized list of failures for the page along with a screenshot:\n\n- Most errors corresponded with missing alt-text for any images that are used to decorate page sidebars or populate thumbnails\n\n- Some of my alt-text descriptions are too long! :laughing: I'll use this example to highlight some of the super helpful features of the WAVE tool. Below is a screenshot of the tool when I select the alert next to the super long alt-text description for a hex logo :woman_facepalming:\n\n    <details><summary>WAVE tool reference and code accompanying an alert</summary>\n\n    ::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](img/wave-ex-alt-text.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Reference pane of the tool elaborates on what the alert means, why it matters, how to fix it, a note on the tool\\'s algorithm, and a link to the WCAG standards and guidelines. Code section is expanded along the bottom and highlights exactly what part of the HTML code the alert is refering to.' width=1898}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    </details>\n\n- My blog and talk listings have redundant links because these layouts have thumbnails enabled and both the thumbnail and the title of the post are active links\n\n- There are 5 alerts (combined) in the navigation bar and footer that appear on every page. These correspond to redundant title links. For example, the link for my Blog has the name \"Blog\" and also the title \"Blog.\" This is something I can fix easily in the **config.toml** configuration file. I was wondering how these two fields were different in that file and now I know!\n\n- The [blog post example](#blog-example) I documented here contained 177 low contrast errors! These were all related to the [arduino syntax highlighting](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/arduino.html) in the various code chunks that I included. The code chunks currently feature primarily gray code against a white background.\n\n### Next steps\n\nI'm _definitely_ not an accessibility expert by any stretch of the imagination. But the great thing is, I don't have to be an expert in order to correct some of these failures! :muscle:\n\nI'm going to need some more Hugo knowledge to correct some of the other ones but I _think_ I've become familiar enough with the Hugo Apéro theme building this site that I _might_ be able to poke around and make some changes. In either case, I'll be documenting my changes in this [a11y series of blog posts](/blog/2021-a11y-website/), so stay tuned and follow along with me!\n> Update (June 7, 2021): I've opened [issue #28](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/issues/28) and have the first changes in branch `wave-audit-1` [available to preview](https://deploy-preview-29--silvia.netlify.app/) before merging.\n\nI'll be learning from the [WCAG primer from TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com/articles/wcag-primer/), recommended by the [a11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/#further-reading), and the [WCAG resources from WebAIM](https://www.w3.org/WAI/roles/designers/).\n\nAnd last but not least:\n\n> **Even if I manage to correct all of these errors and alerts, it doesn't mean my site is fully accessible.** \n\nIt just means it's more accessible than when I began. There are numerous accessibility considerations that are very hard to test for failure (e.g. cognitive accessibility, flexibility, etc.) that I continue to learn about. Also, accessibility is changing all of the time, and we need to be ready to change with it. So just like with R, the learning doesn't stop! :nerd_face:\n\n## Home page\n\nLink: [https://silvia.rbind.io/](/)\n\nAudit results:\n- 1 error\n  - 1 &#120; Missing alternative text\n- 6 alerts\n  - 1 &#120; Suspicious link text\n  - 5 &#120; Redundant title text\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Audit for my home page](img/wave-home.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='There is an error symbol next to the decorative image on the home page.

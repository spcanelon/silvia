Philly's Center City District posted a list of restaurants and bars participating in Philly's 2023 [CCD Sips](https://centercityphila.org/explore-center-city/ccdsips). CCD Sips is a series of summer Wednesday evenings (5-7pm) filled with **happy hour specials**, between June 7th and August 30th.

I prefer to take in this information as a **map** instead of a list, so I scraped some information from the website and made one! You can click or tap on the circle map markers to see information about each restaurant/bar along with a direct link to their posted happy hour specials.

Check out the link at the top of this post for a larger version of the interactive map below, or take a look at CCD Sips maps from [2022](/blog/2022-05-31-ccd-sips) and [2019](/blog/2019-08-04-ccd-sips).

  mapview(parks_accessible, col.region = "cyan") +

```

## Wrangling

```{r wrangling}
# renaming variables ---
schools <- schools |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(school_id = objectid) |> 
  select(school_id, school_name_label, 
         school_address = street_address, zip_code, 
         grade_level, grade_org, enrollment, 
         type, type_specific, geometry)

parks <- parks |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(park_id = objectid) |> 
  select(park_id, public_name, 
         park_address = address_brt,
         property_classification, geometry)

parks_accessible <- 
  
# CRS projections ----
philly <- philly |> st_transform(crs = "EPSG:6564")
schools <- schools |> st_transform(crs = "EPSG:6564")
parks <- parks |> st_transform(crs = "EPSG:6564")
```

## Combining park datasets

```{r}
# TODO: check 02_add_parks.qmd file for GeoBirth-IGNITE
# supplement PAD-US-AR dataset with PPR parks that don't intersect
# resource: https://stackoverflow.com/a/66989798

list_parks <- 
  list(parks_accessible, parks_without_overlap) |> 
  bind_rows() |> 
  st_make_valid()

# merge parks and preserve features
parks <- 
  st_union(list_parks, by_feature = TRUE) |> 
  mutate(park_id = row_number()) |> 
  relocate(park_id, .before = everything())
```

## Example set

```{r}
# subset of schools by objectid
examples <- c("194", "26", "455", "367", "169", "140", "187", "294", "384", "273", "188", "234", "396", "487")
```


## Number of nearby parks

- counting unique parks. so if there are 3 unique parks nested within a "parent" park, all 3 are counted

```{r}
# find parks within a specific buffer size in meters ----

buffer_size <- 250 # meters

nearby_parks <-
  st_join(x = schools,
          y = parks,
          join = st_is_within_distance,
          dist = buffer_size)

# count number of parks within a specific buffer size in meters ----

schools_with_nearby_parks <-
  nearby_parks |> 
  group_by(school_id) |> 
  mutate(number_parks = if_else(
    !is.na(park_id),
    n_distinct(park_id),
    0)) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  mutate(
    number_parks_binary = if_else(
      number_parks == 0,
      "No",
      "Yes"),
    number_parks_binary = fct(
      number_parks_binary,
      levels = c("No", "Yes"))
    ) |> 
  # one record per school
  select(c(school_id:type_specific, 
         number_parks, number_parks_binary)) |> 
  distinct()

```

## Distance to nearest park

```{r sandbox}
test_schools <- schools |> head(3)
test_parks <- parks |> head(5)

# for each school, find index of nearest park (e.g. 1 5 1)
nearest <- st_nearest_feature(test_schools, test_parks)

# create park subset from the nearest park indices
test2 <- test_parks[st_nearest_feature(test_schools, test_parks),]
# test3 <- test_parks |> filter(row_number() %in% nearest)

# combine the school dataset with the park subset
# using mutate with a dataframe skips the y variables 
# that are already in x
# mutate creates new columns from y
test4 <- test_schools |> mutate(test2)

```


```{r}
# Distance to nearest park --------------------------------------
 
# find closest park to school (using indexes)
nearest_park <- schools |>
  mutate(parks[st_nearest_feature(schools, parks),])

# find distance to closest park
nearest_park_distance <- nearest_park |> 
  mutate(distance = st_distance(schools, nearest_park, 
                                by_element = TRUE))

# join back with school info
schools_with_parks <-
  schools_with_nearby_parks |>
  # add distance to park variable
  mutate(distance_to_nearest_park = 
           as.numeric(nearest_park_distance$distance),
         .before = geometry) |> 
  # if school is 0m from nearest park, adjust to 1m
  mutate(
    distance_to_nearest_park = if_else(
      distance_to_nearest_park == 0, 
      1, 
      distance_to_nearest_park),
    .before = geometry)
```

## Summary

```{r}

  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    include = c(number_parks, 
                number_parks_binary,

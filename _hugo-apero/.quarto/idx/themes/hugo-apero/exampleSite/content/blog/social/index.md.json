Here is the tl;dr:\n\n+ site header (set in `config.toml`), \n+ site footer (set in `config.toml`), \n+ [homepage](/) (set in `content/_index.md`),\n+ [about page](/about) in the sidebar (set in `content/about/sidebar/index.md`), and\n+ [contact page](/contact) (set in `content/form/contact.md`). \n\nRead on to learn how to set up your social icons, and how to show/hide them.\n\n\nWherever you end up wanting to show your social icons, you'll need to start by setting up the links in your site `config.toml` file. Open that up and scroll down to the `[[params.social]]` section. The start of it looks like this:\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  \n  # Social icons may appear on your site header, footer, and other pages\n  # Add as many icons as you like below\n  # Icon pack \"fab\" includes brand icons, see: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands&m=free\n  # Icon pack \"fas\" includes solid icons, see: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free\n  # Icon pack \"far\" includes regular icons, see: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=regular&m=free\n  [[params.social]]\n      icon      = \"github\" # icon name without the 'fa-'\n      icon_pack = \"fab\"\n      url       = \"https://github.com/apreshill/apero\"\n  [[params.social]] <!--lather, rinse, repeat-->\n```\n\nFor each link, you'll need to start a new portion that begins with `[[params.social]]`. Then, pick your `icon` and `icon_pack` from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) free icon library:\n\n+ Icon pack \"fab\" includes [brand icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands&m=free)\n\n+ Icon pack \"fas\" includes [solid icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=solid&m=free)\n\n+ Icon pack \"far\" includes [regular icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=regular&m=free)\n\nFinally, add the `url` that you would like users to go to when they click on that icon. All external links (i.e., those that start with `http`) will open in a new tab (that is, `target=\"_blank\"`); relative links to pages within the site will open in the same window.\n\nNow you should be all set to show/hide your social icons. Each of these will pull the social icons and urls from the settings you just created in your site configuration file.\n\n## Show social in site header and footer\n\nLet's start with the header and footer, as those are site-wide. Open up your site `config.toml` file again and scroll down to the `[params]` section (it is actually :up: from where you configured these icons):\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  \n  # show/hide social icons in site header & footer\n  # configure social icons and links below in [[params.social]]\n  socialInHeader = false\n  socialInFooter = true\n```\n\nThat was easy!\n\n## Show social in homepage\n\nOpen up `content/_index.md`. That file's YAML controls what you see on the homepage. Set `show_social_links` like so:\n\n```yaml\nshow_social_links: true # specify social accounts in site config\n```\n\nIf you set this to `true` to show the icons on the homepage, your social icons in the footer will not show up even when you set `socialInFooter = true`, so as not to litter your site with too many icons.\n\n## Show social in about page sidebar\n\nOpen up `content/about/sidebar/index.md`. That file's YAML controls what you see in the sidebar on the about page. Set `show_social_links` like so:\n\n```yaml\nshow_social_links: true # specify social accounts in site config\n```\n\n## Show social in contact page\n\nYou may use the YAML for your contact page (located in `content/form/contact.md`):\n\n```yaml\n---\nshow_social_links: true # specify social accounts in site config\n---\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Set up your social","subtitle":"Social icons may appear on several pages throughout your site.

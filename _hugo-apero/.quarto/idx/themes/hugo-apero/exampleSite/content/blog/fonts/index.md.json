How you do it depends on how much control and customization you need.\n\n\nHugo Apéro includes 6 embedded fonts that work \"out of the box.\" We selected 3 serif and 3 sans-serif options that we thought looked good with this theme, in our humble opinions. All embedded fonts include [real italics](https://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/FakevsTrueItalics) so you may <em>emphasize</em> to your <em>heart's</em> content :heart:! How to choose?\n\nYou may choose fonts for headings and body text in your site's `config.toml` file. Scroll down to find:\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use an embedded font-family\n  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter\n  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Alegreya Sans / Metropolis\n  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too\n  customtextFontFamily = \"Commissioner\"\n  customheadingFontFamily = \"Fraunces\"\n```\n\nHere are the links to each font so you can see them in action:\n\n<h6 class=\"ttu tracked pv3 bt\">Embedded font options</h6>\n    <table class=\"collapse ba bw1 b--moon-gray mv4 w-100\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th class=\"f6 fw6 tl ttu pa3\">Serif options</th>\n          <th class=\"f6 fw6 tl ttu pa3\">Sans-serif options</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"stripe-dark\">\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/\">Fraunces</a></td>\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner\">Commissioner</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"stripe-dark\">\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond\">EB Garamond</a></td>\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans\">Alegreya Sans</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"stripe-dark\">\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter\">Bitter</a></td>\n          <td class=\"pa3\"><a href=\"https://fontsarena.com/metropolis-by-chris-simpson/\">Metropolis</a></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n## Use attractive system fonts\n\nAlternatively, you may want to use a system font, which you know will be rendered reliably across languages, operating systems, and browsers. Apéro uses [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) to render beautiful system font stacks for your site, making it super simple to configure and blazing fast to load. The default choices are `sans-serif` or `serif`, and can be assigned to headings and body text, respectively. Additional options can be found in the [Tachyons Font Family Reference](https://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/). Why use system fonts?\n\n>  Relying on systems fonts greatly improves page performance and can also help your web application/site blend in with the user’s operating system. Readability is strongly linked to familiarity, so this helps create a more fluid reading experience, allowing your users to focus on your content. \n>\n> &mdash; [Tachyons typography docs](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/)\n\nHere is a step-by-step, using the `config.toml` file:\n\n+ Leave both `customtextFontFamily` and `customheadingFontFamily` blank (with empty quotes, or comment out the line entirely).\n\n+ Just below those keys, select a `textFontFamily` and `headingFontFamily` from the options listed [here](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/). All values are lower case, and exclude the `.` in front. \n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use an embedded font-family\n  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter\n  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Alegreya Sans / Metropolis\n  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too\n  customtextFontFamily = \"\"\n  customheadingFontFamily = \"\"\n  \n  # alternatively, leave empty and select basic font options: sans-serif or serif\n  # for more http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/\n  textFontFamily = \"sans-serif\"\n  headingFontFamily = \"serif\"\n```\n\nFor example, you may choose:\n```toml\n  textFontFamily = \"courier\"\n  headingFontFamily = \"baskerville\"\n```\n\nAnd your site would look like:\n\n![](system-font.png)\n\n## Use a custom font\n\nAlright alright alright. So you still want to use your own fonts. You'll need to do a bit more work to get this working, but not too much. If you made it here, I'm going to hope that you know a bit more about [self-hosting fonts](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/).\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n+ Create a `static/fonts/` folder, and add the actual font files you'd like to embed to that folder. To download Google fonts, there is a [popular app](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) to help you. Select a font, then download the zip file containing the font files you'll need to embed.\n\n+ Create an `assets/` folder in the root of your website project (don't add it to your `themes/` directory!).\n\n+ Create a file named `custom.scss` in the new `assets/` folder to define the [`@font-face` CSS rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) for each font/weight combination you downloaded. For example, here is a `custom.scss` that imports the [Nanum Myeongjo font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Myeongjo). The [webfonts helper app](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) will help write your CSS for you (using `../fonts/` to customize the folder prefix correctly by default), like this:\n\n```scss\n/* nanum-myeongjo-regular - latin */\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Nanum Myeongjo';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  src: local(''),\n       url('../fonts/nanum-myeongjo-v15-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), \n       url('../fonts/nanum-myeongjo-v15-latin-regular.woff') format('woff'); \n}\n```\n\nYour final step is to go back to your `config.toml` file and add the `font-family` values for the font(s) you want to use to the `customtextFontFamily` and/or `customheadingFontFamily` keys. You can combine custom fonts with system fonts too. \n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use an embedded font-family\n  # serif options: Fraunces / EB Garamond / Bitter\n  # sans-serif options: Commissioner / Alegreya Sans / Metropolis\n  # if you import your own fonts, name them here too\n  customtextFontFamily = \"\"\n  customheadingFontFamily = \"Nanum Myeongjo\"\n\n  # alternatively, leave empty and select basic font options: sans-serif or serif\n  # for more http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-family/\n  textFontFamily = \"sans-serif\"\n  headingFontFamily = \"\"\n```\n\nHere is what this could look like (thanks to workshop participant [Issac Lee](https://github.com/issactoast)!)\n\n![](isaac-font.png)\n\nIf you do all this, you have my consent to delete the theme's `static/fonts/` folder that holds all the custom embedded fonts so you aren't carrying those unnecessary files around with your site (do not delete the `static/webfonts/` folder- that holds the [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/)!).\n\nFor example, let's examine the 3 commits necessary to make [this magic](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/hachi-maru-pop?subsets=latin) happen:\n\n### Commit #1\n\n![](font-static-files.png)\n\n### Commit #2\n\n![](font-assets-css.png)\n\n### Commit #3\n\n![](font-config.png)\n\n### Final result\n\n![](hachi-font.png)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Style your site typography","subtitle":"Use an embedded font (no CSS required!), rely on system fonts reliably using Tachyons, or bring your own font files- your choice.","excerpt":"This theme offers three ways to customize your site's fonts.

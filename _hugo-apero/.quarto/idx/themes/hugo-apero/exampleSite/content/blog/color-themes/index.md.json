Read on to find out how, and decide which of the \nthree options meets your needs.\n\n\nHugo Ap√©ro includes 8 built-in color themes that work \"out of the box.\" \nThis means you can use a color theme to quickly customize the look of your site\nwithout needing to write any CSS. You can select the color theme in your `config.toml` file. Scroll down to find:\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use a built-in color theme\n  # one of: forest / grayscale / peach / plum /\n  #         poppy / sky / violet / water\n  theme = \"\"\n```\n\nType one of the options like `\"peach\"` inside the quotation marks. If you have a Hugo server started (i.e., by using `blogdown::serve_site()`), when you save the `config.toml` file, your site preview will immediately and automatically update with your new color theme. For example, let's choose `\"peach\"`!\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use a built-in color theme\n  # one of: forest / grayscale / peach / plum /\n  #         poppy / sky / violet / water\n  theme = \"peach\"\n```\n\nYou should see:\n\n![Switching to the peach color theme](peach.png)\n\nIf you select a theme that isn't one of the available options (like `\"pecan\"`), \nyou should see an error message print to your viewer pane in the RStudio IDE:\n\n```bash\nSelected theme 'pecan' is not one of the options.\n```\n\nAll of the color themes were designed to meet [WCAG 2.0 level AA requirements](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/) for contrast ratios.\n\n## Use Tachyons named colors\n\nThis theme uses [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io), a design system that allows you \nto design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.\n\n![Tachyons Logo Script](tachyons-logo-script.png)\n\nWe've leveraged the [accessible color\ncombinations](https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/) included with Tachyons to\noffer an easy way for you to setup your site using your favorite colors. Here are the steps:\n\n+ Create an `assets/` folder in the root of your website project (don't add it to your `themes/` directory!).\n\n+ Create a `.scss` file in the new `assets/` folder.\n\n+ Copy the code below for a full set of color parameters giving you control over the theme color scheme. For an option like `siteBgColor`, for example, you can type one of the predefined color names from Tachyons and save the file. Use only color names as shown in the \"Color Palette\" section of <https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/>.\n\n```scss\n// basic color options: use only color names as shown in the\n// \"Color Palette\" section of https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/\n$siteBgColor: \"near-white\" ;\n$sidebarBgColor: \"light-gray\" ;\n$textColor: \"dark-gray\" ;\n$sidebarTextColor: \"mid-gray\" ;\n$headlineColor: \"dark-pink\" ;\n$headingColor: \"near-black\" ;\n$bodyLinkColor: \"blue\" ;\n$navLinkColor: \"near-black\" ;\n$sidebarLinkColor: \"near-black\" ;\n$footerTextColor: \"silver\" ;\n$buttonTextColor: \"near-white\" ;\n$buttonBgColor: \"black\" ;\n$buttonHoverTextColor: \"white\" ;\n$buttonHoverBgColor: \"blue\" ;\n$borderColor: \"moon-gray\" ;\n```\n\nTwo last steps- back in your `config.toml` file:\n\n1. Leave the theme blank (so `theme = \"\"` with empty quotes) in your `config.toml` file.\n\n1. Add the name of your theme file (minus the `.scss` extension) that you added to `assets/` as the `custom_theme`.\n\nYour final `config.toml` would look something like this:\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use a built-in color theme\n  # one of: forest / grayscale / peach / plum /\n  #         poppy / sky / violet / water \n  theme = \"\"\n  \n  # or, leave theme empty & make your own palette\n  # see docs at https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/blog/color-themes/\n  # the custom scss file must be in the assets/ folder\n  # add the filename name here, without extension\n  # to use hex colors instead of named tachyons colors, include \"hex\" in filename\n  custom_theme = \"named-colors\" \n```\n\n## Bring your own hex codes\n\nLet's say you have a style guide to follow and `washed-blue` just won't cut the\nmustard. There is a bypass of these\npredefined colors built in, you just need to do *one very special extra step*. Follow the steps above for using named Tachyons colors, but then, add `hex` anywhere in the filename for your custom `.scss` (for example, you may name this file `hex-colors.scss`). If you include `hex` in the filename, you get to assign your own HEX codes, like this:\n\n```scss\n// set custom hex colors\n$siteBgColorCustom: #e3e3da;\n$sidebarBgColorCustom: #dbdbd2;\n$textColorCustom: #666260;\n$sidebarTextColorCustom: #666260;\n$headlineColorCustom: #103742;\n$headingColorCustom: #103742;\n$bodyLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$navLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$sidebarLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$footerTextColorCustom: #918f8d;\n$buttonTextColorCustom: #f7f7f4;\n$buttonHoverTextColorCustom: #f9f9f8;\n$buttonBgColorCustom: #103742;\n$buttonHoverBgColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$borderColorCustom: #c4beb9;\n```\n\nAfter adding the name of your theme file (minus the `.scss` extension) that you added to `assets/` as the `custom_theme`, your final `config.toml` would look something like this:\n\n```toml\n[params]\n  <!--snip snip-->\n  # use a built-in color theme\n  # one of: forest / grayscale / peach / plum /\n  #         poppy / sky / violet / water \n  theme = \"\"\n  \n  # or, leave theme empty & make your own palette\n  # see docs at https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/blog/color-themes/\n  # the custom scss file must be in the assets/ folder\n  # add the filename name here, without extension\n  # to use hex colors instead of named tachyons colors, include \"hex\" in filename\n  custom_theme = \"hex-colors\" \n```\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Style your site colors","subtitle":"Use a built-in color theme, or design your own with a Tachyons palette or your own hex codes.","excerpt":"This theme offers three ways to customize your site's colors.

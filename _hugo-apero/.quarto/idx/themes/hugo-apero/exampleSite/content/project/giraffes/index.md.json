It's a design system that provides\nvery small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So,\nrather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write\nyour HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names. This makes for a very\npowerful way to style, in the browser, or while building a static site like this\none – since you can see every change with every save. **It's a joy to use.**\n\nIn using this theme for your next static website project, you won't need to know\nanything about Tachyons ... so, don't freak out. Even though I used it to style\nthe theme, you won't need to change a thing. BUT, if you do want to play around\nwith it, you can make massive changes very easily. Just familiarize yourself\nwith the [clear documentation on the design system](http://tachyons.io/docs/).\nOnce you dive in, you'll recognize all the classes I'm using in the markup.\n\n### BYOTachyons\n\nOne of the best features of Tachyons is the exhaustive [component\nlibrary](https://www.tachyonstemplates.com/components/?selectedKind=AboutPages&selectedStory=AboutUs&full=0&down=0&left=1&panelRight=0)\ncontributed by the community. All those components are built to work with the\nTachyons classes, so they will work in this theme too! You can copy/paste\ncomponents in order to quickly block out a page, then fill in your content.\n\n### Taste the Rainbow\n\nWe've leveraged the [accessible color\ncombinations](http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/) included with Tachyons to\noffer an easy way for you to setup your site using your favorite colors. In the\nsite configuration file (`config.toml`), there is a full set of color parameters\ngiving you control over the theme color scheme. For an option like `siteBgColor`\nfor example, you can just type one of the predefined color names from Tachyons\nand save the file. You can totally customize the theme colors within minutes of\ninstalling the theme.\n\n```toml\n# basic color options: use only color names as shown in the\n# \"Color Palette\" section of http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/\nsiteBgColor = \"near-white\"\nsidebarBgColor = \"light-gray\"\nheadingColor = \"black\"\ntextColor = \"dark-gray\"\nsidebarTextColor = \"mid-gray\"\nbodyLinkColor = \"blue\"\nnavLinkColor = \"near-black\"\nsidebarLinkColor = \"near-black\"\nfooterTextColor = \"silver\"\nbuttonTextColor = \"near-white\"\nbuttonBgColor = \"black\"\nbuttonHoverTextColor = \"white\"\nbuttonHoverBgColor = \"blue\"\nborderColor = \"moon-gray\"\n```\n\n### Dig Deeper\n\nLet's say you have a style guide to follow and `washed-blue` just won't cut the\nmustard. We built Blogophonic for you, too. There is a bypass of these\npredefined colors built in, you just need to dig a little deeper. In the theme\nassets, locate and open the main SCSS file (`/assets/main.scss`). After the\ncrazy looking variables you probably don't recognize and directly following the\nTachyons import (`@import 'tachyons';`) you'll see a comment that looks just\nlike this:\n\n```scss\n// uncomment the import below to activate custom-colors\n// add your own colors at the top of the imported file\n// @import 'custom-colors';\n```\n\nOnce you uncomment the `custom-colors` import, it will look like this:\n\n```scss\n// uncomment the import below to activate custom-colors\n// add your own colors at the top of the imported file\n@import \"custom-colors\";\n```\n\nSave that change, and now the color options in the `config.toml` are no longer\nactive – they've been bypassed. To customize the colors, locate and open the\n`custom-colors` file found in the theme assets (`/assets/custom-colors.scss`).\nAt the top of that file, you'll find a whole new set of variables for all the\nsame color options, but this time you get to assign your own HEX codes.\n\n```scss\n// set your custom colors here\n$siteBgColorCustom: #e3e3da;\n$sidebarBgColorCustom: #dbdbd2;\n$textColorCustom: #666260;\n$sidebarTextColorCustom: #666260;\n$headingColorCustom: #103742;\n$bodyLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$navLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$sidebarLinkColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$footerTextColorCustom: #918f8d;\n$buttonTextColorCustom: #f7f7f4;\n$buttonHoverTextColorCustom: #f9f9f8;\n$buttonBgColorCustom: #103742;\n$buttonHoverBgColorCustom: #c4001a;\n$borderColorCustom: #c4beb9;\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Tachyons for Style","subtitle":"A tachyon /ˈtæki.ɒn/ or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light.","excerpt":"Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons.

All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form\n(`/content/forms/contact.md`). Of course, the example shown below (`your@email.here`) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.\n\n```toml\n# please replace with a valid Formspree form id or email address\nformspree_form_id: your@email.here\n```\n\nUpdate that file and you're ready to begin receiving submissions. Just submit\nthe active form for the first time, and complete the email address verification\nstep with Formspree, and your contact form is live. The next time someone\nfills it out, the submission will land in your inbox.\n\n### Multiple Layouts\n\nThe files included with the theme have a contact page ready for copy/paste, or\nyou can type `hugo new forms/contact.md` and you're off to the races. There are two\nlayouts for `forms` – `split-right`, and `split-left` – you guessed it, one puts\nthe form on the right and the other on the left. You just fill out the front\nmatter, and the rest is automatic.\n\n```toml\n# layout options: split-right or split-left\nlayout: split-right\n```\n\n![Contact Form Split Right Layout Screenshot](built-in-contact-form-screenshot.png)\n\nBoth layouts display the page title and description opposite the form, and you\ncan also choose to show your social icon links if you have those configured in\nthe `config.toml` file.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Bakeoff","subtitle":"An R Package","excerpt":"This theme has a form-to-email feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration.

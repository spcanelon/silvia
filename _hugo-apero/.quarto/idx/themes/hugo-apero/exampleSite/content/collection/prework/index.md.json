We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.\n\n\nSign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.\n\n## Set up GitHub\n\nWe will be using GitHub in this workshop for version control and publishing. Sign up for a free GitHub.com account at <https://github.com/join> if you don't already have one. Also:\n\n+ Complete these [installation instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html).\n    \n+ Test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following [these steps](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html). \n    \n+ **NOTE:** We *strongly recommend* that if you are not already a fluent GitHub user you choose [HTTPS over SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html).\n\n## Brush up on markdown\n\nPlease complete this [10-minute interactive tutorial on Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). \n\n## Installations\n\nPlease bring a laptop that has the following installed:\n\n+ A recent version of R (>=3.6.0), which is available for free at https://cloud.r-project.org/\n    \n+ A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.4), available for free ([RStudio Desktop Open Source License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)). Read up on the latest version [here](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/01/19/announcing-rstudio-1-4/).\n    \n+ The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:\n\n    ```r\n    > install.packages(c(\"usethis\", \"remotes\", \"distill\", \n                       \"postcards\", \"blogdown\"))\n    ```\n    \n    You'll also need to install the development version of the `rmarkdown` package:\n    \n    ```r\n    > remotes::install_github(\"rmarkdown\")\n    ```\n\n## Install Hugo\n\nTo use blogdown, please install Hugo:\n```r\n> blogdown::install_hugo()\n```\n\nAnd ensure your current version is at least as high as:\n```r\n> hugo_version()\n[1] ‘0.79.0’\n```\n\n## Check pandoc\n\nThe RStudio IDE bundles an updated version of pandoc- if you did install v1.4 of the IDE, you should be all set!\n\n```r\n> rmarkdown::pandoc_version()\n[1] ‘2.11.3’\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Prework","weight":1,"subtitle":"","excerpt":"How to prepare ahead of time.","date":"2021-01-01","draft":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

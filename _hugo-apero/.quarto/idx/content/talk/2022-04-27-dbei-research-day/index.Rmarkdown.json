Our study describes a cohort of TBI patients within the Penn Medicine health system and the distribution of TBI injury mechanisms and severity.\n\n### Methods \n\nWe obtained Electronic Health Record data for 1,060,100 female patients treated at Penn Medicine inpatient or outpatient clinics from 2010-2017. We identified patients with TBI diagnoses using ICD-9/10 codes and the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD) definitions for TBI and TBI severity. The CDC/DOD codes for TBI were then manually annotated with mechanisms of TBI injury (e.g. Sport Mechanism of Injury, Collision or Crash, Foreign Body Object). The highest TBI severity category was noted for each patient and defined, in increasing severity, as ‚ÄúMild,‚Äù ‚ÄúModerate,‚Äù ‚ÄúSevere,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPenetrating.‚Äù We report the distribution of TBI mechanisms and severity among this patient population.\n\n### Results\n\nThere were 4,392 patients with a total of 9,800 TBI diagnoses. The majority of diagnoses in the cohort were Mild (5,704; 58%), followed by Moderate (3,840; 39%), Severe (173; 1.8%), and Penetrating (83; 0.8%). The following are the six most common mechanisms observed to contribute to TBI diagnoses: ‚ÄúInjury,‚Äù ‚ÄúMechanism of Injury,‚Äù ‚ÄúAccidents,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhysical Accidents,‚Äù ‚ÄúFall Mechanism of Injury,‚Äù and ‚ÄúTraffic Vehicle Accident.‚Äù\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title":"Exploring Traumatic Brain Injury Mechanisms and Severity Using Electronic Health Records","author":"Silvia Canel√≥n, Rebecca Morse, Mary Regina Boland","date":"2022-04-27T10:00:00","slug":"dbei-research-day","categories":["Research"],"tags":["EHR","TBI"],"event":"2022 DBEI & CCEB Research Day","event_url":"https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/2022ResearchDay","location":"Philadelphia, PA & Virtual","subtitle":"Flashtalk and poster presenting preliminary results for a study on TBI among female patients at Penn Medicine","summary":"Flashtalk and poster presenting preliminary results for a study on TBI among female patients at Penn Medicine","date_end":"2022-04-27T14:00:00","publishDate":"2022-04-27","featured":"yes","links":[{"icon":"th","icon_pack":"fas","name":"poster gallery","url":"https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/2022ResearchDay/presentations"},{"icon":"file-pdf","icon_pack":"fas","name":"poster","url":"/talk/2022-dbei-research-day/Poster.pdf"},{"icon":"play-circle","icon_pack":"fas","name":"flashtalk","url":"https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/2022ResearchDay/silvia-canel%C3%B3n"},{"icon":"file-download","icon_pack":"fas","name":"slides","url":"/talk/2022-dbei-research-day/DBEICCEB-ResearchDay-slides.pptx"}]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

## Description



This panel and discussion event will be focused on R instruction and education. As a learner, what are some recommended resources for developing my R skills? As an instructor, how can I make my materials and presentations more effective? What does data science education look like in 2021? What types of careers are out there in R education? How can I gain experience teaching R?

## Description

I had the pleasure of joining Steffi LaZerte from rOpenSci as a community host for their social coworking and office hours about accessibility.

About 12 of us gathered in a breakout room to chat about all things accessibility, while the rest of the group stayed in the main room for quiet coworking time. I had prepared a list of resources ahead of time, but welcomed folks' questions, curiosities, and opinions guided our conversation. We had a lively and informative discussion!

Collaborative links and notes from the call can be found linked at the top of this post.

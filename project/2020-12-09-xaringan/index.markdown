## Theme <a href='https://github.com/yihui/xaringan'><img src='featured-hex.png' align="right" height="200" alt='Hex logo for the xaringan package. It features the kaleidoscope copy wheel eye from the show Naruto.'/></a>

In preparation for a [xaringan workshop](/projects//xaringan-nhs-r/) I created for the NHS-R 2020 Conference, I designed a custom CSS theme with input from the NHS-R Community that followed the [NHS identity guidelines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/). This theme was also contributed to the [nhsrtheme](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/nhsrtheme#nhs-r-theme-) package developed by Tom Jemmett.

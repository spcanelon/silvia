This year I'm excited to be attending [NICAR 2025](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2025/) which seems to be a wildly popular U.S. conference for data journalists. ü•≥üìä

I built a **build-your-own calendar** tool to help me explore, find, and export a custom selection of sessions to a calendar file. My hope is you find it helpful too! üëáüèΩ

![NICAR 2025 calendar Shiny app](social-card.png){fig-alt="Shiny app table of NICAR 2025 sessions, displaying fields including session type, time, length, skill level, location, and whether the recorded. The interactive options to filter the sessions include a keyword search bar, a radio button for the day of the conference, a slider for the time of day, a search bar for speakers, session type, and skill level, and lastly, a radio button for whether the session will be recorded. Official conference schedule is posted online at https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/index.html"}

If you happen to see me at NICAR, please say hello! It will be my first time attending, and I'll be so happy to meet new folks. If you're curious about [my other journalism projects](#other-journalism-projects), I've curated them in a list below.

## Backstory

As soon as nonprofit [Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)](https://www.ire.org/) posted the [official schedule](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/) of 213+ sessions and workshops I felt like I do when I'm deciding what ice cream flavor I want -- they all look great and, _how was I going to decide???_. I knew some tough decisions would have to be made!

Seeing this list immediately brought memories to RStudio Global 2021, which took place virtually all over the world for a continuous 24 hours. So many of us were trying to make sense of the [long list of sessions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210122034233/https://global.rstudio.com/student/all_events), both when the sessions were happening (across different timezones) and which were in conflict with one another.

The Twitter #RStats community (8 different people!) really came together to crowdsource a solution that used R (of course) to take in these sessions and produce a calendar file that we could import into our personal calendars. By the end of this community effort, Garrick Aden-Buie had built a Shiny app that I adapted for NICAR 2025!

This is my first time building a Shiny app, and it seems like this one may be too complex for shinylive, so I opted to host on shinyapps.io. I have my fingers crossed that the free tier will be enough to handle the traffic! ü§û

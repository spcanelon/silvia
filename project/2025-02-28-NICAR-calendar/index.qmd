This year I'm excited to be attending [NICAR 2025](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2025/) which seems to be a wildly popular U.S. conference for data journalists. 🥳📊

As soon as nonprofit [Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)](https://www.ire.org/) posted the [official schedule](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2025/) of 213+ sessions and workshops I felt like I do when I'm deciding what ice cream flavor I want -- they all look great and I know I know some touch decisions have to be made!

I immediately had flashbacks to RStudio Global 2021, which took place virtually all over the world for a continuous 24 hours. So many of us were trying to make sense of the [long list of sessions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210122034233/https://global.rstudio.com/student/all_events), both when the sessions were happening (across different timezones) and which were in conflict with one another.

The Twitter #RStats community (8 different people!) really came together to crowdsource a solution that used R (of course) to take in these sessions and produce a calendar file that we could import into our personal calendars. By the end of this community effort, Garrick Aden-Buie had built a Shiny app that I adapted for NICAR 2025!

This is my first time building a Shiny app, and it seems like this one may be too complex for shinylive, so I opted to host on shinyapps.io. I have my fingers crossed that the free tier will be enough to handle the traffic! 🤞

If you happen to see me at NICAR, please don't be shy and say hello! I'll be so happy to meet new folks. And please see the list below if you're curious about my other journalism projects.

I used **R** to play around with **webscraping** and create an [interactive map](https://spcanelon.github.io/CCDSips2019.html/) showing restaurants participating in Philly’s 2019 [Center City District Sips](https://centercityphila.org/explore-center-city/ccdsips). Center City Sips is a series of summer Wednesday evenings filled with **happy hour specials**.

This mini-project was motivated by two of my close friends' frustration with the website shortcomings. **The information was presented beautifully, but there was no map view**! This made it difficult to figure out what happy hours you could check out nearby.

The map pop-ups could use information on the specials for each restaurant, but my newly acquired skills with the `RSelenium` and `Leaflet` packages weren't quite up to the task!

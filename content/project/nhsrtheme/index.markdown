## Theme <a href='https://github.com/yihui/xaringan'><img src='featured-hex.png' align="right" height="100" alt='Logo for the NHS-R Community. It features the words "NHS-R Community" and the R is the R project logo.'/></a>

In preparation for a [xaringan workshop](/projects//xaringan-nhs-r/) I created for the NHS-R 2020 Conference, I designed a custom CSS theme with input from the NHS-R Community that followed the [NHS identity guidelines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/). This theme was also contributed to the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package developed by Yihui Xie.

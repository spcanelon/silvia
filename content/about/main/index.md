  I enjoy using [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to optimize my research workflow and have noticed it making guest appearances elsewhere in my life. I'm certified as an [RStudio Tidyverse Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/canelon+silvia/) and am passionate about R education for the public good. Keep up with my R tinkering in my [blog](post) and teaching in [talks](talk). **Thanks** for stopping by!

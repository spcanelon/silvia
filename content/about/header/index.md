Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a data analyst in the [Urban Health Lab](https://www.urbanhealthlab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include applications of biomedical data science in the public and population health fields. I work on projects that use electronic health record (EHR) data and geospatial analyses to explore how the neighborhood environment and access to urban nature can impact the health of individuals in Philadelphia. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
